Do not try hard to do what other game corporations has done before.

+ Treasure chests has fossil fragments, enough fragments -> jig saw game, successful -> get a strong sea animal to fight on your side. Can have multiple pets, they can die, can be heal by hydrobot.
+ Do combos?
+ More types of enemy with cool ability: diver with chain harpoon, you got hit,chained and drag away, got to press a button repeatedly to get freed.
+ Encouraging to heal fish & make fighting more interesting: Heal fish -> fill up a bar, bar filled -> able to do a special move, the things able to do should be dynamic so it will not be linear and boring over time, after doing special move -> bar empty again. Special move or just chance to increase the skill power (but still have to do some educational activity).

Maybe this is a "Goodwill bar", increase everytime you do a good deed (trash, tree, fish). A wheel:
	- Poseidon face: clear all cool down time and refill health
	- Skill icon: increase skill power by 5%
	- Fruit icon: increase attribute by 1
	- Revived fish icon: increase their attribute or power


Survival Mode: If you scrore > x, give more skills to user.

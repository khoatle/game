Do not try hard to do what other game corporations has done before.

+ Treasure chests has fossil fragments, enough fragments -> jig saw game, successful -> get a strong sea animal to fight on your side. Can have multiple pets, they can die, can be heal by hydrobot. Concrete proof for: Fragments of DNA can be achieved from fossil, revive the animal, get the infos.
+ Do combos?
+ More types of enemy with cool ability: diver with chain harpoon, you got hit,chained and drag away, got to press a button repeatedly to get freed.
+ Encouraging to heal fish & make fighting more interesting: Heal fish -> fill up a bar, bar filled -> able to do a special move, the things able to do should be dynamic so it will not be linear and boring over time, after doing special move -> bar empty again. Special move or just chance to increase the skill power (but still have to do some educational activity).

Maybe this is a "Goodwill bar", increase everytime you do a good deed (trash, tree, fish). A wheel:
	- Poseidon face: clear all cool down time and refill health
	- Skill icon: increase skill power by 5%
	- Fruit icon: increase attribute by 1
	- Revived fish icon: increase their attribute or power

+ Skills combination: 2 skill slots, order matters
	- Hammer + Bow = throwing stunning hammer
	- Sandal + Belt = whoever got hit got hipnotized
	- Armor + Belt = whoeer hit you got hipnotized
	- Hammer + Belt = whoever got hit got hipnotized
	- Armor + Hammer = get enough damage = explode
	- etc.
	- Invalid combos = nothing or just one of two happens

+ Remove skill cool down, no mana too, attack a lot refill "skill bar", encourage user to increase Shooting rate (?)... sounds like draining enemy's hp for mana...

+ Fixing oil leak with current and futuristic technology, clean the bubble before it reaches the top, overall making levels more unique (going to different regions finding relics fixing problems)
+ Underwater labyrinth, more complex shipwreck, ice level 
+ Fix problem of random questions in quizz game

+ Survival Mode: If you scrore > x, give more skills to user.
